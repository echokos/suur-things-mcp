# Changelog

All notable changes to `suur-things-mcp` are documented here. Format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this project uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Motion, everywhere it earns its keep.** The dashboard went from literally
  zero CSS transitions to a full calm-motion system modeled on Things 3:
  overlay/panel entrances (scale 0.97 + fade, strong ease-out tokens), an
  optimistic checkoff moment (the ✓ pops the frame you click; a failed write
  visibly reverts), press feedback on every control, rotating sidebar
  chevrons, sliding edit-card editors, content fade-ins with anti-flicker
  loading states, and eased drag-and-drop with a landing settle. ⌘K stays
  deliberately instant (keyboard-frequency rule) and the background poll never
  pulses the view. Full `prefers-reduced-motion` support (movement drops,
  feedback stays). The audit + plans live in `plans/`.
- **Near-live updates.** The board now polls the cheap `/api/cursor` check
  every 5s (a few stat() calls server-side) and reloads only when something
  actually changed — edits made in Things appear on the board within seconds.
- **Multi-select with batch actions.** Shift-click rows to select; a floating
  bar offers Complete / Today / Anytime / Someday / Move to project / Clear.
- **Right-click task menu** on rows and cards: Complete, Cancel, reschedule
  (Today/Evening/Tomorrow/Anytime/Someday), Move to project…, Open in Things.
- **Quick-add parse preview.** While typing `buy milk tomorrow #errand`, dashed
  pills show live what the shorthand will become (📅 tomorrow, # errand).
- **Timeline "now" line** — a red current-time indicator; the day view opens
  scrolled to now.
- **Overdue section in Today** — overdue-deadline items surface under their own
  red header instead of hiding inside project groups; a fully-checked-off Today
  earns a calm "Today is done ✨" moment, and an empty Inbox shows "Inbox Zero ✨".
  Empty lists offer a "＋ Add a task" button that targets the open list.

- **Write verification — tools no longer report success Things didn't deliver.**
  Update-style tools (`update_todo`, `complete_todo`, `cancel_todo`,
  `schedule_todo`, `add_checklist_items`, `update_project`) now reject a UUID
  that verifiably doesn't exist (Things would silently no-op it), and confirm
  the write landed by watching the item's `modified` stamp: the result carries
  `applied: true/false`. All tag-taking tools warn when a requested tag doesn't
  exist in Things — the URL Scheme silently drops unknown tags.
- **Token budgets on read tools.** Every list-returning tool now returns compact
  cards by default (uuid/title/status/dates/tags/project + `has_notes`) with new
  `compact` and `limit` params; `search_todos` caps at 50 results by default.
  Full items via `compact=false`, full detail for one item via `get_item`.
- **`dashboard --install-service` / `--uninstall-service`** — installs a launchd
  KeepAlive LaunchAgent running `dashboard --no-open`, so the board is always
  live at :8876 with no terminal and no browser tab popping on restarts. Refuses
  to install when a foreign process already serves the port.
- **Poll change detection.** The dashboard's 25s auto-refresh first checks a new
  `/api/cursor` endpoint (mtime/size of the DB, its WAL, and board.json — a few
  stat() calls, no DB reads) and skips the reload entirely when nothing changed.
- **reads.py is now tested in CI** against a fixture SQLite database with the
  real Things schema (`tests/things_schema.sql`) — overview digest, sidebar,
  area roll-up, board cards, exact-title resolve. Previously all of that only
  ran on a Mac with Things installed, i.e. never in CI.

### Changed

- **The frontend moved out of dashboard.py** into `static/index.html`, shipped
  as package data (still zero build step, no external assets). dashboard.py
  drops from ~2,500 to ~900 lines; the UI is now editable/lintable as real HTML.
- **Content-Security-Policy on the dashboard.** Scripts are nonce-only: all 59
  inline `on*` handlers were converted to bound listeners, so an injected
  `<img onerror=…>` in a task title is dead on arrival even if an escaping bug
  ever slips in. Plus `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on every response.
- **Single-sourced version** — `__init__.py` owns it; the build reads it via
  hatch (`dynamic = ["version"]`). No more bumping two files in lockstep.
- **Cross-process config lock.** All board.json read-modify-write cycles now
  hold an flock, so the MCP server and the dashboard service (separate
  processes) can't silently lose each other's writes.
- CI now lints (ruff) and installs Chromium so the real-browser dashboard tests
  actually run (they previously always skipped in CI).

### Removed

- Dead `/api/state` endpoint and `reads.board()` (the pre-sidebar dashboard
  shape; the frontend stopped calling it several versions ago).

## [0.8.6] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **The dashboard auto-updates itself.** The running version is baked into the
  page, and the page polls `/api/version` (on a 60s timer, on focus, and on tab
  visibility) — when the server reports a newer version after an upgrade, the page
  reloads itself. No more silently running stale code after an update (especially
  in a Chromium app-mode window, which restores its previous page on reopen). The
  reload is skipped while a card/modal is open so it never interrupts editing.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **The actual "Add does nothing" bug: the title field was invisible.** In the
  quick-add card the title `<textarea>` collapsed to **0 height** — `autoGrow`
  measured `scrollHeight` while the overlay was still hidden (so it read 0), and
  with the checkbox hidden in create mode the flex row had nothing else to give it
  height. With no visible title field, typed text went into the Notes field, the
  title stayed empty, and `createFromCard` silently bailed on `if(!title) return`.
  (This is why it failed for real users but passed every automated test — the
  tests set the title value programmatically.) `autoGrow` now floors the height so
  a field can never collapse, and it runs after the card is on screen.

### Changed

- **Title and notes are now distinct boxed fields.** They were two borderless,
  transparent textareas stacked together, easy to confuse. Each is now a bordered
  input box with its own label placeholder ("New To-Do" / "Notes") and a focus
  ring, so it's always clear which is which.
- Added a headless-browser regression test asserting the title field has a real
  height when the create card opens.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **The real fix for "Add looks dead" with an image.** v0.8.3 moved the slow page
  reads off the event loop, but the quick-add resolve poll still ran its
  `find_by_exact_title` lookups *through the same thread pool* — so if you tapped
  Add while the project's data was still loading (the repo pulse can hold threads
  on `git`/`gh` for seconds), those 3ms lookups **queued behind it** and the add
  stretched to ~5s. The resolve poll now runs its exact-match read **inline** (3ms
  on the loop, no thread-pool round-trip), so it can't be starved. Measured: the
  same "navigate to a project, immediately add with an image" dropped from ~5.3s to
  ~0.23s, even mid-load.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Quick-add with an image no longer looks dead.** Adding a to-do with a staged
  image could take 5–8 seconds before the card closed (sometimes long enough that
  you gave up before the task was created). The read endpoints (`/api/state`,
  `/api/sidebar`, `/api/items`, `/api/item`, `/api/board`) still ran their SQLite
  reads **synchronously on the event loop** — so while the page loaded its data
  (the sidebar alone scans ~1.3k projects), the quick-add resolve poll's
  `asyncio.sleep` clock stretched from ~1.8s to many seconds. Those reads now run
  off the event loop (`run_in_threadpool`), bringing the same add from ~5.3s back
  to ~0.3s. (Completes the v0.8.0 blocking-handler fix, which only covered writes.)

## [0.8.2] - 2026-06-21

Quality pass: the deferred follow-ups from the v0.8.0 audit, dependency bumps,
and the project's first real JavaScript test coverage.

### Added

- **Headless-browser test harness** (pytest + Playwright). The dashboard ships its
  UI as embedded JS with no JS runner; `tests/test_dashboard_browser.py` now loads
  the real page in Chromium and asserts the client-side behaviours pure-Python
  tests can't reach — XSS escaping (`jsarg`), the quick-add re-entry guard + button
  feedback, and a clean (exception-free) boot. Tests skip when Chromium isn't
  installed, so plain `uv run pytest` still works; CI installs it and runs them.

### Changed

- **Quick-add UUID resolution is faster and more reliable.** Resolving a new item's
  UUID now uses an exact-title DB read (`find_by_exact_title`) instead of polling
  the `LIKE`-based search up to a dozen times — the old search could even miss the
  title entirely (its tokenization didn't always match), silently failing to link a
  staged image.
- **Centralized dashboard fetch error handling.** All ~29 frontend `fetch()` calls
  now go through `getJSON`/`postJSON` helpers that return `{ok:false, error}` on a
  network/parse failure instead of throwing silently — no more stale spinners when
  the server restarts.
- Dependency bumps: starlette 1.3.1, uvicorn 0.49, mcp 1.28, pytest 9.1.1;
  CI actions checkout v6 + setup-uv v8 (clears the pending Node-20 deprecation).

### Fixed (polish)

- Organize-job slot is now reserved under a lock, so two concurrent requests can't
  both pass the single-job cap.
- `ensure_running` waits for the server to accept connections before opening the
  browser (no more "connection refused" on a just-launched tab).
- SQLite read URIs are path-quoted (handles a DB path with spaces/`?`/`#`).
- `attach_image` checks file size before reading and uses a context-managed handle.
- Checklist inputs are capped at 100 items (`max_length`); attachments capped at 24
  per item so `board.json` can't grow unbounded.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-05

Security + robustness hardening pass, from a full-codebase review (eng review +
Codex audit). No behavior change for normal use.

### Security

- **Stored XSS in the dashboard fixed.** A project/area title was interpolated
  into an inline `onclick` JS string via `encodeURIComponent`, which doesn't
  escape `'` — a crafted title could execute script in the dashboard origin (which
  can drive same-origin APIs incl. opening local files/apps). Now escaped with a
  `jsarg()` helper that closes the `'` hole.
- **Path traversal on attachment upload fixed.** The `/api/attach` endpoint used
  the request's `uuid` directly as a directory name; a `../`-shaped value could
  write outside the attachments dir. `save_attachment` now validates the id and
  verifies the resolved path stays under the attachments dir.
- **Organizer agent hardened.** The spawned `claude`/`codex` CLI now runs in an
  empty temp directory with secret-shaped env vars stripped (tokens, API keys,
  cloud creds — the agent's own auth is preserved), so a prompt-injected task
  can't read+exfiltrate credentials. The docstring no longer overstates the Codex
  sandbox's guarantees.

### Fixed

- **Config can no longer be silently lost or corrupted.** `board.json` is now
  written atomically (temp file + `os.replace`), so an interrupted or concurrent
  write can't leave a truncated file. A genuinely corrupt config is backed up to
  `board.json.corrupt-<timestamp>` instead of being silently replaced with empty
  defaults (which the next save used to make permanent).
- **Dashboard no longer freezes during writes/pulse.** Blocking work — the Things
  URL-scheme `open`, `git`/`gh` subprocesses, and SQLite searches — now runs off
  the event loop (`run_in_threadpool`), so one slow request can't stall the whole
  dashboard.
- **POST endpoints validate input.** Malformed JSON or wrong-typed fields (e.g.
  `tags: "abc"`) return a structured 400/error instead of a 500.
- `batch` now caps operation count (250) and serialized size (~100KB) before
  building the URL, instead of risking an oversized `open` argv.
- Dashboard search routes through `reads.search`, so the `THINGS_DB` override is
  honored (and the query runs off the event loop).

## [0.7.3] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **`dashboard --no-open`** — run the dashboard as a quiet background service:
  bind the port and serve, but never open a browser. Intended for a login agent
  (launchd/systemd) that keeps the dashboard alive across restarts without popping
  a tab every time. Without it, a `KeepAlive` agent that loses the port (e.g. a
  second instance grabbed it) relaunches in a loop, opening a browser on each
  restart.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **Add button could get stuck disabled forever.** The 0.7.1 fix disabled the
  button while attaching, but `uploadAttachmentTo()` wrapped a `FileReader` in a
  Promise that never settled if the file read errored or the `/api/attach` request
  threw — so the `await` never returned, `CREATING` stayed `true`, and the button
  stayed disabled until a page reload. It now has a `reader.onerror` handler and a
  `try/catch` around the upload, so the Promise always resolves and the button is
  always restored.
- **Staged image could change mid-submit.** `createFromCard()` read `PENDING_ATTACH`
  *after* the `/api/add` round-trip, so pasting, removing, or dropping an image
  during the (async) wait could attach the wrong image or none. The staged set is
  now snapshotted at submit time.

### Tests

- Added regression tests asserting the quick-add guards (re-entry lock, button
  disable/restore, in-flight label) and the attach Promise's always-settle paths
  (`reader.onerror`, `try/catch`, submit-time snapshot) are present in the served UI.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **Quick-add "Add" button looked dead with an image attached.** When a new
  to-do or project carries a staged image, the server has to discover the new
  item's UUID by polling Things' database (the URL Scheme doesn't return it),
  which can take several seconds on a large library. During that wait the button
  stayed enabled with no feedback, so it read as a no-op — and a second impatient
  click created a duplicate. The button now disables and shows "Adding…" /
  "Adding image…" while the request is in flight, and a re-entry guard blocks
  duplicate submits.
- **Silent failures in quick-add.** `createFromCard()` had no error handling, so
  a thrown `fetch` (or any exception) failed silently — the overlay just sat
  there with no message. It now surfaces the error in an alert and always
  restores the button state.
- Realigned `__version__` in `__init__.py` (had drifted to `0.2.0`) with the
  package version.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Priority Levels** — a 2×2 grid (P1–P4) that ranks tasks by your *existing*
  Things tags, not a separate browser overlay. Available from the sidebar (over
  Today) and as a **view toggle** on any list, area, or project. Map real tags to
  each level (e.g. `🔴` → P1) in the ⚙ editor; a task lands at the first level
  whose tags it carries. Drag a task between levels and the mapped tag is written
  back to Things via the URL scheme (the old level tag is replaced in the same
  write). Read-only when `THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN` isn't set — it still shows what's
  already tagged. The tag→level map is stored in `board.json` (`priority_levels`),
  never in Things.
- **App-window mode** — `suur-things-mcp dashboard --app` (or the `open_dashboard`
  tool with `app=true`) opens the dashboard in a frameless Chromium app window
  (no tabs or address bar, its own Dock icon) instead of a browser tab. Prefers
  Chrome → Brave → Edge → Chromium → Vivaldi → Arc; falls back to a normal tab.
- **Drag a task onto a heading** — in a project, drop any task on a heading (e.g.
  "iOS App") to move it under that heading, via the URL Scheme's `heading` param.
  A "no heading" drop zone (it appears at the top only while you're dragging) pulls
  a task back out to the top of the project.
- **Linked repos on the project (and area) page** — open a project and its linked
  repos show right under the notes, with the same chips (open in editor / terminal /
  GitHub), a "🔗 repos" manager, and the git/GitHub pulse (commits/wk, last commit,
  open PRs) you'd see on a Kanban card — so you get them even when the project isn't
  on any board.
- **Areas roll up their projects' tasks** — selecting an area now shows the tasks
  living inside its projects, grouped by project, alongside the area's loose
  to-dos. Things only shows an area's loose to-dos; this makes an area a real
  overview of everything under it. A **"Project tasks"** pill in the header (next
  to the view switcher, shown for areas in every view) turns the roll-up off (back
  to project cards only); the choice is saved per area in `board.json`
  (`area_prefs`).
- **Image attachments** — Things can't store images, so attach them here instead.
  Drag, paste, or pick an image in a task's edit card and it shows inline in the
  dashboard. Bytes live on disk under `~/.config/suur-things-mcp/attachments/`;
  only metadata goes in `board.json`. With `THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN` set, a clickable
  `file://` reference is appended to the task's notes so the Things app shows it too.
  - New `attach_image(item_uuid, source_path, caption)` MCP tool so an agent can
    attach a chart/screenshot it generated; `get_item` now reports `attachments`.
  - Endpoints `POST /api/attach`, `GET /api/attachment`, `POST /api/detach` —
    the serve endpoint only returns files recorded in the overlay and rebuilds the
    path server-side, so it can't be used to read arbitrary files.
  - A task with an image shows an **image icon** next to the note icon in the list,
    so attachments are visible at a glance.
  - The Things note now reads **"🖼 Image attached: …"** (clearer that there's an
    image), and the append is idempotent (re-attaching won't duplicate the line).
  - **Creating a to-do now uses the same card as editing one** — the ＋ button opens
    the full edit card in a "new" mode (To-Do/Project toggle, notes, when/deadline/
    tags, and the 📎 attach tool). You can **attach an image while creating**: it's
    staged in the browser, then linked once the to-do exists (its new ID is resolved
    server-side, since the URL Scheme doesn't return it). Project notes also
    **linkify bare domains** now (e.g. `hrv.suur.io`), not just `https://` URLs.

> Note: attached images are local to this machine (plus wherever the config folder
> syncs). They are not in Things Cloud and won't appear on iOS.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-26

From early dashboard feedback.

### Fixed

- **Organize** no longer reports "no agent CLI found" when the dashboard is
  launched outside a shell (GUI/launchd/Things URL). It now resolves
  `claude`/`codex` via the login-shell PATH and runs them with that PATH.
- **Anytime/Someday** no longer render projects as (checkbox-less) task rows —
  built-in lists show to-dos only; projects stay in the sidebar.
- Tasks can now be **completed directly from the Matrix / Priority view**.

### Added

- ⌘K surfaces **New to-do / New project** as the first quick actions.
- Natural-language quick-add understands **relative dates** — "in 4 weeks",
  "in 3 days", "next week/month/year".

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-25

### Security

Hardens the local dashboard's browser boundary. These are local-first issues:
they require the dashboard to be running and the user to load a malicious page
in the same browser. No data is ever exposed to the network.

- **Dashboard reads are now Host-checked.** Added `TrustedHostMiddleware` so any
  request whose `Host` isn't `127.0.0.1`/`localhost` is rejected — closes a
  DNS-rebinding path that could read task titles/notes and linked repo paths.
- **Cross-origin POSTs are properly blocked.** The origin guard now matches the
  full origin (scheme + host + port), not just the hostname. Previously a page
  served from a *different localhost port* could drive state-changing requests
  (config, repo links, open-in-editor, quick-add).
- **Auth token no longer leaks on errors.** The Things auth token is now redacted
  from URL-Scheme error/timeout messages, not only from success responses.
- **Organize agent runs without the token.** `THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN` is stripped from
  the environment of the spawned `claude`/`codex` CLI.

### Changed

- Pinned GitHub Actions to commit SHAs and added Dependabot; committed `uv.lock`
  for reproducible installs.
- Fixed invalid `\s`/`\d` escape sequences in the embedded dashboard JS.
